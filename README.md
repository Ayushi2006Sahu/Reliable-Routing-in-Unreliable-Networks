# Reliable Routing in Unreliable Networks

This project focuses on designing a routing strategy for real-world networks where communication links are unreliable.  
Instead of assuming perfect connectivity, each link in the network is associated with a success probability.

The objective of the project is to find a routing path between a source and a destination that maximizes the end-to-end success probability.

## Motivation

In real-world scenarios such as wireless networks, IoT systems, and satellite communication, links often fail due to noise, interference, or congestion.  
Traditional routing algorithms generally assume reliable links, which makes them less effective in such environments.

This project addresses that gap by incorporating link reliability directly into the routing decision.

## Problem Overview

- The network is modeled as a graph.
- Nodes represent devices or routers.
- Edges represent communication links.
- Each edge has an associated success probability.
- The goal is to determine the most reliable path between two nodes.

## Methodology (High-Level)

- Model the network as a probabilistic graph.
- Convert link success probabilities into additive weights using logarithmic transformation.
- Apply Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to compute the most reliable route.
- Evaluate routing performance under random link failures through simulations.

(Detailed explanation is provided in the methodology document.)
